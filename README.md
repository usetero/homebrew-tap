# Homebrew Tap for Tero

Official Homebrew tap for [Tero](https://usetero.com) - a control plane for observability that optimizes telemetry data quality.

Tero sits on top of your existing observability tools and builds semantic understanding of your telemetry data. It identifies waste patterns and helps you take action without dropping signals that matter. This isn't about cutting costs by dropping logs—it's about optimizing for value instead of volume.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap usetero/tap
brew install tero
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
tero --version
```
